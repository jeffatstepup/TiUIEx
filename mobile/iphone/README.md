TiUIEx for iOS
===========================================

This module extends the standard Ti.UI components to add features that I need
for my various development projects.

See - https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TC-1908 

Removed TabGroup and Toolbar components - they prevented the build from linking as the relevant Ti UI libs were excluded from the build.
